Every project needs a set of goals, so that you don't lose track along the way.

|Goals for this RPG gaming system|

1. Customizable / Adapatable
- Playable in settings from mideval to space-age
- Items and such not pre-made, but systematically created by DM / groups per campaign
- Might be too ambitious, we'll see
 
2. Sytematic / Formulaic
- Makes sense
- Elegant
- No need to memorize hundreds of different rules and execptions
- Not necessarily simple, can be complicated but in a way that makes sense

3. Fluid, Well-Paced Gameplay
- Battles should be faster; when one minute of battle takes an hour of real time, you have a problem IMO
- This way, characters aren't unconscious for mutliple sessions on end
- #1 applies to this; things should be fast or slow as per the group's needs
- There should be some sort of structure to how characters do non battle things, so that people constantly talking over each other
and people taking hours IRL time to describe how they climb trees can be avoidable

4. Balanced Gameplay
- There should be just as much focus on things that aren't combat
- Systems and stuff for non-combat

5. Strategic Gameplay
- Combat system should be rewarding to players with a strategy
- Provide lots of opportunity for the DM to make their players think
